# 🏥 HealthSync

> A secure, privacy-first digital healthcare platform that enables patients to manage, share, and access their medical records with complete control.

HealthSync aims to solve the problem of fragmented healthcare records by providing a centralized, consent-based platform where patients, hospitals, and insurance providers can securely access medical information. The platform emphasizes data privacy, secure authentication, and seamless healthcare interoperability.
